        <h1 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h1>
            <p align="justify">Recently, data engineering, by generating synthetic data, active learning, label and data augmentation and self-supervision, is getting traction in the medical imaging community and is slowly showing impacts in the different domains. However, the potential of these methods is not fully leveraged yet. A recent study on the quantification of data augmentation introduced affinity and diversity to measure the improvement in model generalization by augmentation. 
              The study shows that both the augmentation's affinity and diversity need to be optimized to improve the model's generalization. Similarly, studies suggests that not every synthetic example improves the generalizability of the model but instead hurts the performance. Sub-sampling useful examples are crucial to improve performance. Also, the performance due to self-supervised learning methods on the downstream tasks is generally conditioned on overlapping the pretext task with the downstream tasks.
               For e.g. a model trained on predicting a rotation angle is not going to be effective in Colons or other rotationally invariant organs. We witness various research efforts being made in the data engineering domain, most of them are often made in silos. 
               And many research questions in data engineering remain open that are of utmost importance to the success of machine learning methods used for medical image analysis. For example:
              - What kind of data to generate to train a model for a given medical task? 
              How to identify the diverse and discriminative examples for a downstream task in complex biomedical datasets? For example, do we need to annotate every frame in a surgical video?
              - How to Identify the correct augmentation policy rather than just employing random policies? For e.g. vertically flipping the lungs can label the right lung as the left lung. Similar issue arises in Chest X-ray too.
              - Given a data labeling budget (time/money), what is the best way to spend it? For example, how much data should we collect and how much of it should we label? 
              - How to learn to synthesize the data for a downstream medical task?
              - How to design suitable pretext tasks based on the downstream medical task? 
              - Overall, how can we blend these data-related works to get maximum benefit out of the data?
              
            </p>  
            <p align="justify"> The workshop invites researchers to submit their work in the field of medical imaging around the central theme of data engineering.
